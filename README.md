# Gaussian-beam-B.Sc.-Thesis
  This project contains the programs that I have developed for my B.Sc. thesis "Characterization of the optical components of a new chirped-pulse Fourier transform spectrometer", under supervision of Prof.Dr. Stephan Schlemmer and Dr. Nadine Wehres at the university of Cologne.  Within the project, I calculated the beam profiles (Beam-Calculation) and extracted the beam widths from experimentally extracted beam intensity maps (Beam-plotting), where I compared them to the theoretical values. Due to faults in the beam measuring device, I also developed an algorithm to filter out incomplete or noisy data.
